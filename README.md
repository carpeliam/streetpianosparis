Paris Piano Finder
===================

An app to track which of the [Paris Street Pianos](http://streetpianos.com/paris2016/) you've played. Uses `localStorage` to keep track across sessions, and sorts by distance (using the Haversine formula, so it's closest as the crow flies, not via driving directions, so maybe not as useful as you'd like?).

The [Paris Street Pianos](http://streetpianos.com/paris2016/) are leaving on Wednesday July 13th, so hurry up and play them all!
